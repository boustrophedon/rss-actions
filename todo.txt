db: update filter with last updated time

high level: `rss-actions update`
fetch feeds from db
download feeds from urls
  - sort by pubDate
fetch filters from db
for each filter:
  most_recent_update = filter.last_updated
  for each entry in the filter's feed:
    if most_recent_update is none or most_recent_update < entry.pubDate:
      run filter.script with feed data (dry run: print)
  set last_updated in db to most_recent_update (dry run: print most recent update)



in update inner loop, add option to use lastBuildDate instead of pubDate

probably will never do:
add verbose flag to list filters command to show full script path
